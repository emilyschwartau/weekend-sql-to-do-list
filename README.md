# WEEKEND-SQL-TO-DO-LIST

## Description

A full-stack to-do list application that takes in a task via a user input, and has the option to mark the task complete, or to delete the task. All updates are reflected both on the DOM and in the database.

The project is solved through a series of server-side methods, demonstrating use of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. The requests are executed via click handlers which render to the DOM and update the database.
